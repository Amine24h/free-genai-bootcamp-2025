## Functional Requirements

The company aims to invest in its own infrastructure due to concerns about user data privacy and the rising costs of managed GenAI services.  

They plan to purchase an AI PC with a budget of **$10,000–$15,000**. Their user base consists of **300 active students**, all located in **Nagasaki**.  

## Assumptions  

- We assume that the selected open-source LLMs will be capable of running efficiently on hardware within the **$10,000–$15,000** budget.  
- A **single server** connected to the internet from our office should provide sufficient bandwidth to support the **300 students**.  

## Data Strategy

To avoid **copyright concerns**, we must purchase and store **licensed materials** in our database for student access.  

## Considerations

We are considering using **IBM Granite** because it is a fully **open-source model** with **traceable training data**, helping us avoid copyright issues and maintain transparency in model operations.
